# Nipah_localPhi

### About This Project

This is a pseudo-Bayesian model framework for evaluating the probability that a pathogen will successfully jump hosts. This project expands on the model in --. instead of relying on the number of spillover events or some rate of spillover, this framework utilizes demographic data and outbreak chain length to construct the posterior probability of a host jump, conditional on the outcomes of past spillover events.
